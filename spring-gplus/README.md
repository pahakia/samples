pahakia samples - spring-gplus
==

This is a standard java web app integrating Spring (including JPA) with Google+.  Personally I found integration with Spring Security is too
complicated.

If you still want an example of integrating Spring Security with Google+, please refer to the project spring-gplus-jpa.

Please copy pahakia.properties.example to $SETTINGS_DIR/pahakia.properties and replace
the google.plus.client.id and google.plus.client.secret with your own.

Note the port has to be the one you specified in google developer console when you create the google plus client id and secret.
