pahakia samples - spring-gplus-jpa
==

This is a standard java web app integrating Spring (including JPA and Security) with Google+.  Personally I found integration with Spring Security is too
complicated.  So I removed Spring Security part in the project spring-gplus.

Please copy pahakia.properties.example to $SETTINGS_DIR/pahakia.properties and replace
the google.plus.client.id and google.plus.client.secret with your own.

Note the port has to be the one you specified in google developer console when you create the google plus client id and secret.
